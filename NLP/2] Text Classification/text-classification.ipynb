Instead, you need to convert the text to something numeric.\n\nThe simplest common representation is a variation of one-hot encoding. You represent each document as a vector of term frequencies for each term in the vocabulary. The vocabulary is built from all the tokens (terms) in the corpus (the collection of documents). \n\nAs an example, take the sentences \"Tea is life. Tea is love.\" and \"Tea is healthy, calming, and delicious.\" as our corpus. The vocabulary then is `{\"tea\", \"is\", \"life\", \"love\", \"healthy\", \"calming\", \"and\", \"delicious\"}` (ignoring punctuation).\n\nFor each document, count up how many times a term occurs, and place that count in the appropriate element of a vector. The first sentence has \"tea\" twice and that is the first position in our vocabulary, so we put the number 2 in the first element of the vector. Our sentences as vectors then look like \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nv_1 &= \\left[\\begin{matrix} 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix}\\right] \\\\\nv_2 &= \\left[\\begin{matrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThis is called the **bag of words** representation. You can see that documents with similar terms will have similar vectors. Vocabularies frequently have tens of thousands of terms, so these vectors can be very large.\n\nAnother common representation is **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**. TF-IDF is similar to bag of words except that each term count is scaled by the term's frequency in the corpus. Using TF-IDF can potentially improve your models. You won't need it here. Feel free to look it up though!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Building a Bag of Words model\n\nOnce you have your documents in a bag of words representation, you can use those vectors as input to any machine learning model. spaCy handles the bag of words conversion and building a simple linear model for you with the `TextCategorizer` class.\n\nThe TextCategorizer is a spaCy **pipe**. Pipes are classes for processing and transforming tokens. When you create a spaCy model with `nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')`, there are default pipes that perform part of speech tagging, entity recognition, and other transformations. When you run text through a model `doc = nlp(\"Some text here\")`, the output of the pipes are attached to the tokens in the `doc` object. The lemmas for `token.lemma_` come from one of these pipes.\n\nYou can remove or add pipes to models. What we'll do here is create an empty model without any pipes (other than a tokenizer, since all models always have a tokenizer).
