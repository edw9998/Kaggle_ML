The first is \"lemmatizing.\"\nThe \"lemma\" of a word is its base form.  For example, \"walk\" is the lemma of the word \"walking\". So, when you lemmatize the word walking, you would convert it to walk.\n\nIt's also common to remove stopwords. Stopwords are words that occur frequently in the language and don't contain much information. English  stopwords include \"the\", \"is\", \"and\", \"but\", \"not\". \n\nWith a spaCy token, `token.lemma_` returns the lemma, while `token.is_stop` returns a boolean `True` if the token is a stopword (and `False` otherwise).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"Token \\t\\tLemma \\t\\tStopword\".format('Token', 'Lemma', 'Stopword'))\nprint(\"-\"*40)\nfor token in doc:\n    print(f\"{str(token)}\\t\\t{token.lemma_}\\t\\t{token.is_stop}\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T02:45:21.866582Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T02:45:21.867039Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T02:45:21.875556Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T02:45:21.867003Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T02:45:21.873128Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Token \t\tLemma \t\tStopword\n----------------------------------------\nTea\t\ttea\t\tFalse\nis\t\tbe\t\tTrue\nhealthy\t\thealthy\t\tFalse\nand\t\tand\t\tTrue\ncalming\t\tcalm\t\tFalse\n,\t\t,\t\tFalse\ndo\t\tdo\t\tTrue\nn't\t\tnot\t\tTrue\nyou\t\t-PRON-\t\tTrue\nthink\t\tthink\t\tFalse\n?\t\t?\t\tFalse\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Why are lemmas and identifying stopwords important? Language data has a lot of noise mixed in with informative content. In the sentence above, the important words are tea, healthy and calming. Removing stop words might help the predictive model focus on relevant words. Lemmatizing similarly helps by combining multiple forms of the same word into one base form (\"calming\", \"calms\", \"calmed\" would all change to \"calm\").\n\nHowever, lemmatizing and dropping stopwords might result in your models performing worse.

You can do pattern matching with regular expressions, but spaCy's matching capabilities tend to be easier to use.\n\nTo match individual tokens, you create a `Matcher`. When you want to match a list of terms, it's easier and more efficient to use `PhraseMatcher`.
